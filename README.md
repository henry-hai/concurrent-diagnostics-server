# Concurrent Diagnostics Server

## Overview
Detailed multi-threaded HTTP server implemented in Java for serving system diagnostic data. [cite_start]Designed for high-reliability characterization and performance analysis. [cite: 134]

## Key Features
* [cite_start]**Thread-per-Request Architecture**: Handles simultaneous diagnostic requests by spawning dedicated threads for each client connection. [cite: 134]
* [cite_start]**Data Integrity**: Uses robust TCP/IP socket programming to ensure reliable transmission of system status reports. [cite: 134]
* [cite_start]**Resource Management**: Optimized thread lifecycles to prevent memory leaks in persistent hardware diagnostic environments. [cite: 134]

## Technical Stack
* [cite_start]**Language**: Java [cite: 16]
* **Protocols**: HTTP, TCP/IP
